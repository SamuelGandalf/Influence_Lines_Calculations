# Influence_Lines_Calculations
This is a python code to calculate and draw influence lines diagrams in civil engineering structural analysis. 
There is a tkinter gui for taking the question which is then linked to the backend code that does the actual mathematical calculations involved in influence lines. 
The code for now only works with simple supported beams.
Other forms of beams such as #cantilever beams #hinge beams #roller supports are yet to be incorporated in the code.
